### 2. ChatwithPDF

Explore the innovative ChatwithPDF project, a unique endeavor that involves extracting responses from PDF files using the Llama2 API. This dynamic project goes a step further by storing the extracted information in CassandraDB, a powerful vector store database. Leveraging the capabilities of HuggingFaceEmbeddings, this project showcases the seamless embedding of text within the CassandraDB.

Project Features:
PDF Interaction: Extract meaningful responses from PDF files using the Llama2 API.
Database Storage: Utilize CassandraDB, a vector store database, to efficiently store and manage the extracted information.
Text Embeddings: Leverage HuggingFaceEmbeddings to embed text, enhancing the overall processing capabilities.

### 3. Blog Generation App

Dive into the world of effortless content creation with our Blog Generation App. This application simplifies the blogging processâ€”just provide the topic, the intended audience, and the desired length, and let the magic happen. The underlying code not only streamlines the content generation but also demonstrates the utilization of locally stored Language Model (LLM) models through CTransformers. Powered by the LLama 2 API, this project offers a seamless and efficient way to generate engaging blog content.

Project Features:
Intuitive Blogging: Create engaging blog content with minimal input â€“ just specify the topic, audience, and desired length.
Local LLM Models: Explore the method of using locally stored Language Model (LLM) models using CTransformers.
LLama 2 Integration: Leverage the LLama 2 API to enhance the efficiency and capabilities of the blog generation process.

### 4. Chat to DataBase

Experience the simplicity of querying a database without the need for SQL expertise with our innovative Chat to DataBase project. This project empowers users to interact with a MySQL database using straightforward questions, making database queries accessible to everyone. By incorporating the Google Palm LLM and leveraging a few-shot training method along with prompt templates, the project ensures an intuitive and user-friendly interaction. Dive into the details by exploring the code in the experiment.ipynb file, and run the main project effortlessly using the main.py file.
